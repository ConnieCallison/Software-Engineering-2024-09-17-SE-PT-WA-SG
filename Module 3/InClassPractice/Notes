Notes on Time Complexity

0(n) represents a linear time

time complexity can be constant (instant), linear, or exponential

the easiest way to understand which time complexity is appropriate is to think about the time it would take to physcially complete the task (like imagine a librarian sorting through books to find the oldest book for example as linear time)
